# Guide
Using Value Objects will avoid duplication of code, as well as make your properties more typed.

## Usage
Value Objects this library are divided into several logical groups:

- [Web](usage/web.md)
- [Identity](usage/identity.md)
- [Security](usage/security.md)
- [Person](usage/person.md)
- [Geography](usage/geography.md)
- [Option](usage/option.md)
- [Money](usage/money.md)
- [Payment](usage/payment.md)
- [Content](usage/content.md)
- [Enum](usage/enum.md)

But, this separation is only a structuring of the Value Objects in library. You can use these objects as you discretion.
